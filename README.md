# School_District_Analysis
In depth analysis of Math and Reading scores from 15 different schools based on disctrict, school, grades, spending, size and type.

## Given that the score averages for ninth graders from one high school are incorrect, a reanalysis was performed on the data.
- After replacing the reading and math scores of 9th graders from Thomas High School, the disctrict summary showed realitely little change in decrease of the average math score from 79 to 78.9 and the percent of students passing math and reading decreasing 1% from 75% to 74% and 86% o 85% respectively. This decrease leads to an overall passing rate decrease from 65% to 64%.

- In the school summary, the percent of students passing math at Thomas high school significantly decreased from 93% passing to 66% passing and the percent of students passing reading decreased from 97% to 69%. The schools overall passing rate decreased from 90% to 65%
This in turn dropped Thomas High School from being the top 2/15  high school with a 90% Overall Passing rate to the Top 8/15 High School with an Overall Passing rate of 65.1%

- The math and reading scores by grade use to show a score of 83 which was about the average of all 9th graders from all the school, but now they show NaN.

- The average math and reading scores by school spending are relatively unaffected. But the percent of students passing math and reading within the spending range that Thomas High School fell into decreased from 73% to 66% for math, 84% to 77% for reading, and 62% to 56% overall.

- The scores by school type are unaffected

- The percent passing math and reading decreased for the “Medium” sized schools dropping from 94% to 88% and 97% to 91% respectively. This leads to a drop in overall passing rate from 91% to 85%
